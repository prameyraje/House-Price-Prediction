# House-Price-Prediction
Problem Statement

Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-a) Create a robust machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the
price of the house given the various factors across the market.

b) Determine the relationship between the house features and how the
price varies based on this.

Task3:- Come up with suggestions for the customer to buy the house according
to the area, price and other requirements.

Dataset Description :
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won&#39;t begin with
the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this
playground competition&#39;s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations
than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

Practice Skills
● Creative feature engineering
● Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

Model Comparison Report
Create a report stating the performance of multiple models for house price
prediction and suggest the best model for production.

Report on Challenges faced
Create a report which should include the challenges faced on data and
what techniques were used with proper reasoning.

Note:- All the above tasks must be created on a single jupyter notebook
and the same should be shared as part of final submission of the project.
